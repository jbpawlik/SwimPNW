## Capstone Project: SwimPNW

Work Schedule:

9/17/2021 - (I had to delete and reinstall this project because I wanted to use create-react-native-app instead of react-native init; I'm hoping it will install to the same repo but I'm not sure. I've been working since like 6AM either way)

6-8: Catching up on some career services stuff and reading about Firebase
8-10: React Native CRUD tutorial with Firebase
10: Still working on this stupid tutorial
11:Why do tutorials always start by having you install a bunch of modules that cause a ton of problems, so then you uninstall them all and the rest of the tutorial works fine?
12:Lunch
1: I tried installing the finished repo of this morning's tutorial so I could see what it was supposed to be like, but even that didn't work. I'm moving on to some other tutorials.
2:15: Working on another tutorial. This isn't very exciting to read about, I imagine.
3: Doing some work on my actual project (which will probably get scrapped a couple of times)
3:45: Starting to add some js files to my project
4:40: Getting pretty deep into learning about hooks
